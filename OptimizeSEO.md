# Optimize SEO for my Portfolio website

## Objective
optimizing a personal website with a strong emphasis on the strategic use of the individual’s name (Shayan Behzadisam), ensuring maximum visibility and relevance in search engine results.

## Page Titles
Ensure all `<title>` tags explicitly communicate the individual’s name. Example homepage title: `Shayan Behzadisam`. For internal pages, follow the format: `Shayan Behzadisam - [Page Content]` (e.g., `Shayan Behzadisam - Portfolio Website Project`).

## Meta Description
Draft concise meta descriptions (150–160 characters) that clearly state the individual’s name, profession, and primary value proposition. This text appears below the page title in search engine results.

## Headings Structure
Utilize headings (H1, H2, H3) to reinforce the personal brand. The primary H1 on the homepage should include the name and profession (e.g., `Hi, I'm Shayan Behzadisam, experienced IT Manager, AI Specialist, Full-Stack Developer, and Data Analyst`). Subheadings should maintain consistency and relevance.

## Content Integration
Incorporate the individual’s name organically throughout the website’s textual content, prioritizing the "About Me" section and project descriptions. Articulate skills, experience, and unique value offerings.

## Image Alt Text
Apply descriptive alt text for all images, embedding the individual’s name where contextually appropriate (e.g., `alt="Portrait of Shayan Behzadisam, experienced IT Manager, AI Specialist, Full-Stack Developer, and Data Analyst"`).

## Schema Markup Implementation
Deploy "Person" schema markup to provide structured data that clarifies the website’s personal focus. Include properties such as:
- `name`: Full legal name (Shayan Behzadisam)
- `jobTitle`: Current profession (experienced IT Manager, AI Specialist, Full-Stack Developer, and Data Analyst)
- `url`: Primary website URL (https://shayan-behzadisam.web.app/)
- `sameAs`: Verified social profile URLs (https://www.linkedin.com/in/shayan-behzadisam/)
- `alumniOf`: Relevant educational institutions (Computer Engineering @ Istanbul Beykent University)
- `worksFor`: Freelance

Utilize tools such as Google’s Structured Data Markup Helper to generate valid JSON-LD scripts. Embed these scripts within the `<head>` section of relevant pages to assist search engines in accurately indexing personal information.
